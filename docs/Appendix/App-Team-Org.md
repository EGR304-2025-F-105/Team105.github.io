### Main Method for Group Communication

Group will primarily use phone number group chats as a way to contact one another for this main project. If there is any issues, we will use discord as a secondary communication hub.
 
## Communication Procedures

1. During the weekend, there will be virtual discussions about the project dependant on individual's schedule.
1. Pairs of two will handle physical instructor correspondence and report back during the meetings. When it comes to virtual, there will be one person who then will document what is said and report back to the group.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

1. When there is missing contributions, there will be a discussion about why something isn't done and what steps are needed to achieve the goal.
1. Instead of outing an individual and critize them, we will talk as a team about support and how we can achieve the end goal without risking morale drop. 
1. If the performance isn't improving, there will be certain steps that will help out with the situation:
    1. A discussion with the professor as a mediator about why the situation isn't improving.
    1. Pink Slip 
    1. Ask about removal from the team as the very last resort if nothing has changed.
