## Intro/overview

As a group, we collectively decided to base our main project on electrical blinds. To achieve our product mission statement of helping individuals by reducing manual steps with their household appliances, electrical blinds offer users to be able to go about their days while technology is programmed to do whatever the user inputted for the day. This ranges from closing the blinds automatically when the weather reaches a certain temperature or when the lights are dim enough, then the blinds are lifted because of the coolness.

## Generating Ideas

We broke out into individual groups to create 25 different ideas.

| Requirement / need | Feature | Detail |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Product operates silently | Whisper-quiet motor | A low rpm motor to move blinds slowly to limit mechanical noise. |
| Product operates silently | Soft motion | Gradually engaged acceleration and deceleration to prevent clicking of gears or motors |
| Product operates silently | Vibration resistant mounts | Rubber or silicone fittings to absorb vibrations that may be generated from blind usage |
| Product operates silently | Low friction track system  | Coating gears or tracks in oil or grease to prevent sound due to mechanical friction |
| Product operates silently | Sealed product housing | Encapsulate the full products housing to limit and dampen sound from use. |
| Product updates user | Mobile app dashboard | Displays all current status of blind and temperature engagement |
| Product updates user | LED indicator | A light to reflect current mode eg. heating, cooling, idle |
| Product updates user | Voice assistant  | Hooks into alexa or goggle home systems for quick updates |
| Product updates user | Energy savings report | Monthly phone notification summarizing months results from blind usage |
| Product updates user | Motion feedback | Blinds pause or briefly “bounce” before engagement to display a new setting is engaged |
| Product reduces power usage | Adaptive movement scheduling | Instead of constant adjustments the blinds will periodically ping to check whether an adjustment is within range |
| Product reduces power usage | Sleep mode | Once temperature and light levels are within idle range product limits all other features |
| Product reduces power usage | Solar powered microcontroller | Draws from solar energy first before using any supplied battery power |
| Product reduces power usage | Position memory | Product stores last position in temporary memory to avoid needing to scan and calibrate itself to identify previous positioning. |
| product reduces power usage | Reduced sensor polling | When within ideal ranges, sensors and probes will only read the environment half as often. |
| Product emphasizes user safety | Obstacle detection sensor | Reads above and below lowest point of blinds and will not activate if something would impede operation |
| Product emphasizes user safety | Overheat protection | Shuts all operations off if internal housing becomes too hot |
| Product emphasizes user safety | Child safety lock | Prevents manual operation while active |
| Product emphasizes user safety | Safe construction | Only smooth edges and flame resistant materials |
| Product emphasizes user safety | Automatic fault alerts | Notifies user of any physical errors preventing blind operations |
| Product supplies suggestions | Energy optimization tips | Informs user of ideal settings to limit use of HVAC |
| Product supplies suggestions | Comfort reminders | Suggests manual adjustments during periods of unnatural weather |
| Product supplies suggestions | Routine based advice | Learns user preference and suggest setting and timers that match the users current cycle and habits |
| Product supplies suggestions | Seasonal memory | Remembers trends of past seasons to better adjust to internal and external climates of current areas trends. |
| Product supplies suggestions | Maintenance alerts | Offers routine updates of when product may need service from charging batteries to replacing motors. |
