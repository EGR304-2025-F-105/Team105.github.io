## Intro/Overview

The group collectively decided to base the main project on electrical blinds that is dependent on temperature. To achieve the product mission statement of helping homeowners save on electricity bills, these electrical blinds offer users to be able to go about their days while the product is programmed to either lift/lower blinds dependent on temperature and adjust the blind's slates dependent on the position of the first actuator. 

## Generating Ideas

The group decided to branch individually and create 25 ideas for the product wants and needs. Afterwards, the group got together and went over the ideas and sorted on what they wanted the product to have and what was needed to achieve the product mission statement.

## Reflection

Some of the ranked items in the GSR portion unfortanatley did not make it to the final design as some ideas were outside of the scope of learning or did not make sense in the long run. Though bluetooth capabilities seemed interesting to include, it would require extensive research and properties that are prohibited in the final stages of the product. Other ideas were combined with one another as some were dependent on one another to function such as product being to heavy therefore choosing smaller components that still function.
