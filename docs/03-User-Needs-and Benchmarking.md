## User Needs and Statement

We seperated the user needs into four different categories to get an idea for the main project: Solar, Thermo, Pressure/Gas, and Water. Each category has about 25 ideas each as each member reached a minimum of 5 user needs. This then turned into a statement.

![User Need: Solar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EGR304-2025-F-105/Team105.github.io/refs/heads/main/docs/image/UBNI1.pdf%20(1).png){style width:"350" height:"300;"}

## Voice of the Customer (VOC) 

For VOC, each individual choose seperately on which topic they wanted to research. In total, the group found 6 products that match the 4 categories.

## Ranking

The ranks go from number 1 to 6 which 1 ranked as important while 6 is not so interesting. On the right side of Figure 11, some bullet points were removed as they would require extensive research and is out of scope of the class.

## Reflection

As a team, they decided to combine the light sensor and solar blinds to create the idea of temperature equalizing blinds. With temperature-based blinds, the group can use their extensive knowledge from the coursework to set up a system where the blinds could roll either up/down and adjust blind's slates dependent on temperature value.
