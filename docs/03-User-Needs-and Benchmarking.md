## User Needs and Statement

We seperated the user needs into four different categories to get an idea for the main project: Solar, Thermo, Pressure/Gas, and Water. Each category has about 25 ideas each as each member reached a minimum of 5 user needs. This then turned into a statement.

## Voice of the Customer (VOC) 

For VOC, each individual choose seperately on which topic they wanted to research. In total, the group found 6 products that match the 4 categories.

## Ranking

The ranks go from number 1 to 6 which 1 is the project we are most intrigued about. On the right side of Figure 11, we took out some bullet points that we thought would be best to think about when going in depth for this project.
