## Team Introduction
> This will be updated as part of the preparation for the External Review.<br>
>     We are a team of engineering students from Arizona State University, sharing a vision of transforming the innovative concepts of embedded system into feasible market ready solutions. While the foundation we hold is academic, our approach mirrors that of a startup; combining technical expertise with entrepeneurial thinking, in designing products that solve every day household issues.<br>
