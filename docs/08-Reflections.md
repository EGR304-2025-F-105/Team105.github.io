## Lessons Learned 

There were several trials that were encountered within the duration of the project. Despite that, the team was able to think of solutions to bypass the trials which are listed below:

1. The importance of time management: there was a month to make sure everything was working which was difficult to keep up as there were many goals to acheive, but not enough time for the simpliest stuff like debugging or sudden changes
1. Making multiple plans for different scenerios: as the PCB maker was broken, we had to alternativily change the way the PCBs were manufactored such as ordering JLC. Or when one board was not working.
1. Double check your parts: There were times that things were not working which required multiple hours of checking and revisiting old material which was time consuming.
1. Importance of communication: the team needed to change a lot of things within the project which required talking to professors, TAs and people who dealt with orders.
1. How team dynamics change the project: Though the beginning was rough for the team, the dynamic improved over time which helped the quality of work.
1. Feedback is critical: many of the changes happened because of feedback which helped our quality of work and made us think critically.
1. Understanding code: though there were issues with the prototyping, many of the issues that came from not understanding the code.
1. PCB design in KiCad needs to be worked on carefully: the PCB design was sent to JLC without fixing critical errors which made some boards unusable.
1. There needs to be testpoints: test points are important parts that are highly recommeded to make sure things work.
1. Documentation is key: it is hard to do everything at once, so makeing sure things are steadily updated are important.

## Recommendations
For the future students that take this course, Team 105 created a list of recommendations:

1. It is important to communicate with teammates about the projects and goals that need to be achieved.
1. Time management is a need for this course as there are so much to learn within a short amount of time.
1. Never be afraid to talk top the professors or TAs about topics that you do not know about. 
1. MPLAB is complicated in some areas, so make sure to take time to learn about it.
1. Always have backup plans to make sure things sail smoothly as many things could happen unexpectly.
