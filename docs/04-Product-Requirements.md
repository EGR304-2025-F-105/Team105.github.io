## Project Objective

This project aims to investigate and develop an electrical system dealing with blinds to help improve user's households by elimating the need to continously opening/closing the blinds manually dependent on temperature and time. Almost all households have blinds installed to their household to help save on energy with the lighting and temperature. Additionally, as technology, there is a rise of customnization within households to increase user comfortablility and energy efficiency. According to Global Market Insights based on the year 2024, there is a 8.9% increase on the curtains and window blinds market in the year 2025 as the rise of urbanization is happening. With these numbers, we aim to creating a automatic blind system that detects the temperature and lighting volume which in turn, either open or close for the user. We will obtain a series of sensors: timer, outdoor/indoor temperature, and light. 

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** Middle to lower-middle income individuals between the ages of 20 and 40. As the increase of urbanization happens, they are more likely to move into towns and cities that can utilize this product.  
- **Target purchaser** Target purchasers who are looking for a way to eliminate an extra step in there day-to-day activities using technology. 
- **Retailers** Allows to sell to users who are looking to buying this product. In which, they would recieve a profit for each purchase.
- **Communities** City-Folks (Urban) who want to customize their living space while they are doing personal tasks outside their residence


## Use Cases

1. **User Story #1: [Rafa P.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24MC8D2ODUDMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8)**
      * "I really like this blinder as is very easy to to operate and a true color and brings lots of privacy to the room.
The movement is smooth and proper speed but could be a bit noisy, specially in the evenings.
Installation is quite straightforward if you got proper measurements."
  
1. **User Story #2: [Katie](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ET17LP6APP5D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8)**
      * "Love the blind. Works well. It is too long for most windows. Wish they had a shorter version, however, I control the blind to close it for the evening while I set up a time every morning for the blind to automatically open. It works for me."
        
1. **User Story #3:[Shelby](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OLCTS1E9GPKY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8)**
      * "Love these. These have been such a good addition to our living room so we don’t have to climb over the couch to close blinds anymore. They work great so far! And they look great"

## Aspects

The new product design will be based on that of existing electrical blinds; however, we will be adding in a temperature detectors into the system.

1. **Product Design**
      * 1.1 Product shouldn't be a copy and paste of already existing products.
      * 1.2 Should be size accesibile to all types of users. 
      * 1.3 the blinds could be a traditional blind design or roller shades.
      * 1.4 There is a manual cord or blind rod for users as a "just-in-case" scenerio. 
  
1. **Functionality**
      * 2.1 Reads indoor and outdoor temperatures, then adjusts blinds automatically to regulate heat gain or loss.
      * 2.2 Uses integrated solar panels to power sensors, motors, and controls without needing external wiring.
      * 2.3 Offers manual override via smartphone app, voice assistant, or onboard buttons for user preference.
      * 2.4 Should provide feedback on energy saved.

1.  **Interactivity and User Experience**
      * 3.1 Users can set desired temperature ranges, light levels, or schedules for how the blinds respond.
      * 3.2 Compatible with platforms like Alexa, Google Home, or Apple HomeKit for easy voice or app control.
      * 3.3 Provides simple indicators (LED lights, app notifications) to show whether the blinds are in heating, cooling, or neutral mode.
      * 3.4 Allows quick manual adjustment of blinds without interfering with automated settings, ensuring users feel in control.

1.  **Customization**
      * 4.1 Product should be able to adjust in width to fit multiple size windows.
      * 4.2 Product should be available in multiple colors.
      * 4.3 Product should allow for multiple types of slats.
      * 4.4 Product should allow for pieces to be swappable.
      
1.  **Manufacturing**
      * 5.1 Product should be under 10 pounds.
      * 5.2 Product should require less than 20 steps for physical assembly.
      * 5.3 Product should cost less than $240 to manufacture.
      * 5.4 Product should take less than 10 minutes to assemble.

1.  **Safety**
      * 6.1 Having a system that stops regulates power intake to prevent fires.
      * 6.2 Having a way for the system or sensor to stop intself from hurting the users and damaging surrouding areas.
      * 6.3 Ensure that users can do proper maintenance in a safe manner. 
      * 6.4 The weight of the product is neutral enough that won't cause issues for users.

## Requirement Criteria Specifications

* 1.1.1 - Regulate system power to make sure overloading happens (Need to figure out the power supply overall).
* 1.1.2 - Provide over-amperage project to not exceed a certain amount of amps.
* 1.1.3 - Once it reaches a certain temperature (23°C), blinds switches to close.
* 1.1.4 - Once a timer sets off, the blinds either open or close dependent on time based of if weather is neutral or user inputs. 

## Open Questions

* Can we somehow intergate a coding system that if the weather is neutral in the temperature sensor, then it switches to a timer sensor? 
* Can we create a product that can easily be installed and removed without any trace of its use?
* In what ways could the blinds provide meaningful feedback (e.g., energy savings, comfort improvements)?
* How much control should the user have over automation versus manual adjustment?
