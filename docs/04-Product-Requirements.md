## Project Objective

This project aims to investigate and develop an electrical system dealing with blinds to help improve user's households by elimating the need to continously opening/closing the blinds manually dependent on temperature and time. Almost all households have blinds installed to their household to help save on energy with the lighting and temperature. Additionally, as technology, there is a rise of customnization within households to increase user comfortablility and energy efficiency. According to Global Market Insights based on the year 2024, there is a 8.9% increase on the curtains and window blinds market in the year 2025 as the rise of urbanization is happening. With these numbers, we aim to creating a automatic blind system that detects the temperature and lighting volume which in turn, either open or close for the user. We will obtain a series of sensors: timer, outdoor/indoor temperature, and light. 

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** Middle to lower-middle income individuals between the ages of 20 and 40. As the increase of urbanization happens, they are more likely to move into towns and cities that can utilize this product.  
- **Target purchaser** Target purchasers who are looking for a way to eliminate an extra step in there day-to-day activities using technology. 
- **Retailers** Allows to sell to users who are looking to buying this product. In which, they would recieve a profit for each purchase.
- **Communities** City-Folks (Urban) who want to customize their living space while they are doing personal tasks outside their residence

## Aspects

The new product design will be based on that of existing electrical blinds; however, we will be adding in a temperature detectors into the system.

1. **Producr Design**
      * 1.1 Product shouldn't be a copy and paste of already existing products.
      * 1.2 Should be size accesibile to all types of users. 
      * 1.3 the blinds could be a traditional blind design or roller shades.
      * 1.4 There is a manual cord or blind rod for users as a "just-in-case" scenerio.

1.  **Safety**
      * 6.1 Having a system that stops regulates power intake to prevent fires.
      * 6.2 Having a way for the system or sensor to stop intself from hurting the users and damaging surrouding areas.
      * 6.3 Ensure that users can do proper maintenance in a safe manner. 
      * 6.4 The weight of the product is neutral enough that won't cause issues for users.e

## Requirement Criteria Specifications

* 1.1.1 - Regulate system power to make sure overloading happens (Need to figure out the power supply overall).
* 1.1.2 - Provide over-amperage project to not exceed a certain amount of amps.
* 1.1.3 - Once it reaches a certain temperature (23Â°C), blinds switches to close.
* 1.1.4 - Once a timer sets off, the blinds either open or close dependent on time based of if weather is neutral or user inputs. 

## Open Questions

* Can we somehow intergate a coding system that if the weather is neutral in the temperature sensor, then it switches to a timer sensor? 
*
