## Project Objective

This project aims to investagate and develop an electrical system dealing with blinds to help improve user's households by elimating the need to continously opening/closing the blinds manually dependent on temperature and time. Almost all households have blinds installed to their household to help save on energy with the lighting and temperature. Additionally, as technology, there is a rise of customnization within households to increase user comfortablility and energy efficiency. According to Global Market Insights based on the year 2024, there is a 8.9% increase on the curtains and window blinds market in the year 2025 as the rise of urbanization is happening. With these numbers, we aim to creating a automatic blind system that detects the temperature and lighting volume which in turn, either open or close for the user. We will obtain a series of sensors: timer, outdoor/indoor temperature, and light.

## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Jenna**
Jenna is a 33-year-old executive who regularly visits a bar for lunch to blow off some steam. The bar is often loud with people, but it is paramount that she can hold business conversations over the phone there. Then again, she does not want to miss out on the atmosphere and be able to hear the waiters as well. Her new Apple wireless earphones allow her to switch instantly between a mode where she can fully focus on the phone conversation and a mode where the phone call and environmental sound are seamlessly combined. They also allow her to rapidly adjust the volume on the earbuds themselves without having to take out her phone.

Jenna occasionally visits the bar in the evenings. She is a big fan of the L.A. Lakers, and whenever they play, she streams the live footage through her phone. Her new earbuds allow her to easily switch to hearing everything around her and streaming the match commentary without having to ever take the earbuds out.  She sometimes gets compliments on how stylish the earbuds look on her, and she wouldnâ€™t want to miss out on hearing those either.

## Aspects

The new product design will be based on that of the AirPods with improvements based on the following requirements. The **P1 - P10** is the "code" to indicate the priority of the requirement, from low to high.

1. **Producr Design**
   * 1.1 The product shall be visually easy to distinguish from existing AirPods as well as main competitors Sony WF-1000XM3, Jabra Elite, Amazon Echo Buds, Samsung Galaxy Buds, and Bose SoundSport Free, and Urbanista Stockholm. (P10)
   * 1.1 The product shall be easy to recognize as an Apple product without needing a logo on its exterior. (P10)
   * 1.2. The product shall avoid styling elements from our Powerbeats over-ear wireless headphones since those address a different market segment. (P8)
  
1. **Functionality**
      * 2.1 The product shall incorporate one or more optical proximity sensors to detect the user wearing it. (P10)
      * 2.2 The product shall offer a dual microphone in each earbud. (P10)

## Requirement Criteria Specifications

* 1.1.1 - Regulate system power from 9 volts to 5 volts
* 1.1.2 - Provide over-amperage project to not exceed 1.5 amps.

## Open Questions

* Can we move towards a recyclable and repairable product, for example, with ZIF connectors and glue-free assembly?
* Can we improve on failing or self-igniting batteries?
