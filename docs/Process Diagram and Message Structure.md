## Introduction

The group decided that the electric blinds would require the the 4 main functionalities: light sensor, motors, motion sensors, and thermometer sensor. How the blinds will function is by having the light sensor read the light levels from its location. Addition to the light sensor, there will be two thermometers with one detecting the internal temperature of the house while the other detects the outside/against the window temperature. With that, the emitter detector will then tell the motor one to either stop or continue the flow of action of the blinds. Motor two will adjust the slates dependent on the light value/temperature. There is an emergency stop scenerio where if there is an object blocking the way of the blinds through the sensor, then the product will stop. 

## Research Question

* How to connect the motors simultaneously with two subsystems.
* How can we tell the product to stop when there is something blocking (going more into depth about the scenerio coding).
* How can we work the light sensor and the thermometer sensors together to tell the product the light and temperature value.

## Conclusions and Future Work

With the diagram, it showcases the links that each funcation has and how it connects to one another through the wiring. With the thermomter, it is connected to both the motion sensor and the light sensor as a way to tell the two sensors the temperature that it is sensing. With that, the light sensor can determine if the brightness level is high to give signal to the motor to shut the blinds. The motion sensor detects the surroundings and gives signal when an obstacle happens. With the second motor, it would be used as a way to adjust the sliders dependent on light level.
