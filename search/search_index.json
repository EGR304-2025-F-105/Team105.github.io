Almost all households have blinds installed to their household to help save on energy with the lighting and temperature. Additionally, as technology, there is a rise of customnization within households to increase user comfortablility and energy efficiency. According to Global Market Insights based on the year 2024, there is a 8.9% increase on the curtains and window blinds market in the year 2025 as the rise of urbanization is happening. With these numbers, we aim to creating a automatic blind system that detects the temperature and lighting volume which in turn, either open or close for the user. We will obtain a series of sensors: timer, outdoor/indoor temperature, and light. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#stakeholders","title":"Stakeholders","text":"<ul> <li>Target group Middle to lower-middle income individuals between the ages of 20 and 40.

Addition to the light sensor, there will be two thermometers with one detecting the internal temperature of the house while the other detects the outside/against the window temperature. With that, the emitter detector will then tell the motor one to either stop or continue the flow of action of the blinds. Motor two will adjust the slates dependent on the light value/temperature.
